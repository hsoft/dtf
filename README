DTF - Dans Ta Face
==================

This is a Django 1.5 project coded in Python 3. Therefore, to install it, you'll have to fetch
Django's beta and install it manually. Then, it's as simple as:

python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver

For now, the website itself isn't very interesting. What's interesting is the scraping functionality
that have been implemented. They're ran as django commands. For example, if you want 2012's
contributions from DGEQ, do:

python manage.py scrapedgeq 2012

Have fun!
